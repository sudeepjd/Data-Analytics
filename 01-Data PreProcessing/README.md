# Data PreProcessing

When we receive data from any source, we need to check if the data is good data, or clean it up to make it good data. We also need to transform the data into a format that the system understandsâ€¦ Mostly this is the conversion of textual data into numeric data.

## This Folder has the following:

* Data.csv
* Google Colab file for doing this with Python
* KNIME folder for doing it with KNIME
